# Repair manuals
1. Official stellantis web-based elearn manual
   <p><a href="https://aftersales.fiat.com/elearnsections/SelectModel.aspx?languageID=2&markID=3">Click me!</a><p>
   <p>Reccomended because it's the most up to date, accurate repair manual, and includes features that the others don't.</p>
2. Elearn ISO
   <p><a href="https://en.lanciaclub.net/manuals.php?ddlb_model=14&kols=2">Click me! WARNING: I DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS THIS DOWNLOAD MIGHT PRODUCE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</a></p>
   <p>Best repair manual for offline use, that is somewhat accurate</p>
3. 4cardata
   <p><a href="https://4cardata.info/elearn">Click me!</a></p>
   <p>A last resort if others don't fit you, or you're on mobile. It's like the elearn ISO, but has a lot of missing parts</p>
# Useful tips
1. Date bug workaround
   <p>Your Thesis' time if off and you can't change it manually because of the GPS? Just remove the GPS!</p>
   <p>In the passenger footwell (in right hand drive countries), remove the trim towards the gear shift, and proceed to remove the gray plug, and now you can set the time!</p>
2. Door makes a pop sound when closing
   <p>When you go to close the door, does it make a weird pop sound? Just screw the door guide!<p>
   <p>Using the car's provided tools (located in the spare tire), screw the door guide's screw</p>
3. EOL flashing on dash after replacing NIT screen (the display with controls)
   <p>There are two methods to follow so choose accordingly</p>
   <p>1. Get the original board located behind the connector's metal casing into the new one</p>
   <p>2. Perform a PROXY ALIGNMENT with an OBDII scanner</p>
4. External audio source
   <p>You may get tired of listening to the radio, or burning CDs, and want to use your phone as a audio source.</p>
   <p>While a FM transmitter might be a good idea, it doesn't provide great sound quality, and often needs changing the frequency. So I recommend to use a cassette adapter to get the best sound quality, while not having to tinker with electronics or buy a sophisticated CD Changer emulation system</p>
